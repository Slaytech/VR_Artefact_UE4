The VR artefact developed for my project, contains Unreal Engine source code / project data.

IMPORTANT: In order to access this project, you will require at least Unreal Engine 4.15 (or higher). A HTC Vive will be required
to fully utilize the VR experience.

This project represents the experiment component of an investigation into "Learning Development in Virtual Reality", with the
purpose of exploring the factors that impact on the immersive experience of Virtual Reality Learning Environments, 
and the factors dictating learning development for young adults within a virtual space.
